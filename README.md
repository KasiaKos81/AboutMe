- 👋 Hi, I’m Katarzyna Kos. I have finished an intensive Software Testing course at Software Development Academy, where I gained the   necessary skills such as preparing Test Cases, Bug reports, writing simple tests in Selenium webdriver and basics of SQL. Thanks to my previous professional experience I have acquired interpersonal skills, that will certainly be an asset in the communication field between Tester & Developer. To improve my programming and test automation skills I have strated another course concerning Java Programming language. 
- 👀 I’m interested in developing my knowledge in the field of Test Automation and Java programming language
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Test Automation (focus on Selenium Webdriver) and Java Programming Language
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Software Testing
- 📫 You can reach me by my LinkedIn profile www.linkedin.com/in/katarzyna-k-gd
